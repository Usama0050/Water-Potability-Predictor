**Overview**

This project uses a machine learning model trained on a water quality dataset to predict whether a given water sample is potable (safe to drink) or not potable, based on features like:

pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity.

**Model Details**

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Classifier

Data Source: Kaggle - Water Potability Dataset

**Features**

Predicts water potability using 9 chemical and physical features.

Clean and interactive UI with real-time predictions.

Fast and lightweight deployment using Streamlit.
